The Avail team provides official Docker images designed to run nodes on the **Kate testnet**. While these guidelines focus on setting up a Full Node, they can easily be modified to accommodate the requirements for running a validator node.

## Before You Start

The following instructions are tailored for Linux distribution with `apt` 
support, such as Debian.Note that the available Docker images are compatible 
only with **Linux/amd64 or x86_64 based** CPUs. Running nodes on a cloud server 
is also common. Recommended hardware specifications for your environment are 
provided below:

| Minimum                            | Recommended                         |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 4GB RAM                            | 8GB RAM                             |
| 2 core CPU amd64/x86 architecture  | 4 core CPU  amd64/x86 architecture  |
| 20-40 GB SSD                       | 200-300 GB SSD                      |

**Port 30333** is typically required for peer exchange. Ensure this port, 
along with any others needed for machine access, is open when setting up your firewall 
or cloud provider's security groups.

#### Alternate Networks & Releases Information

The instructions provided are specifically for the **Kate testnet**.
To connect to a different network, you may need to download an alternate node version
from the [node releases
page](https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases) and acquire the corresponding
chain specification file. For any queries, feel free to reach out to the Avail team.

## Initial Setup

At this point, you should have shell access with root privileges to a linux machine.

### Install Docker

If you do not have Docker installed, please follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

In this guide, we will use the Ubuntu-specific installation instructions. It's advisable to consult the official guidelines for the most up-to-date information.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
```

At this point, you should have Docker installed.

To avoid running Docker as the **root** user, which is often inconvenient, we'll adhere to the post-installation steps outlined [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). This allows us to interact with Docker without requiring **root** privileges.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

```

You should now be able to log out and log back in, and execute Docker commands without the need for **sudo**.

## Disk Setup

The specific steps will vary significantly based on your requirements. Typically, you'll have a root partition for the operating system on one device, and one or more separate devices for storing blockchain data. For the remainder of this guide, we'll assume that the additional storage device is mounted at `/mnt/avail`.

Before mounting the additional disk, it's advisable to format it and create a filesystem. For guidance on this process, you can [follow these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html).

In this example, we're working with a 300 GB device located at `/dev/nvme1n1`. The steps to mount this device are outlined below:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/avail
sudo mount -a /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/avail
Use the the `df -h` command to verify that the mount has been successfully configured.

If everything appears to be in order, it's advisable to create additional sub-directories for storing our data and configuration files.

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/avail/config
sudo mkdir /mnt/avail/state
sudo mkdir /mnt/avail/keystore
```

Based on your specific use case and operating system, you'll likely need to add an entry to `/etc/fstab` to ensure the device remains mounted upon system reboot.

In our scenario, we'll proceed as follows:

```bash
# Use blkid to get the UUID for the device that we're mounting

blkid

# Edit the fstab file  and add a line to mount your device
# UUID={your uuid}      /mnt/data   {your filesystem}   defaults    0   1
sudo emacs /etc/fstab

#you can use any test editor based on your prefereance to edit the file here we have used emacs .

# use this to verify the fstab actually works
sudo findmnt --verify --verbose
```

At this stage, you should be able to reboot and verify that the system correctly mounts your device upon startup.

## Avail Setup

Download the Correct Chaispec file for the network in our case we are using the **`Kate-Testnet`** Chainspec.

   
   | Network      |Docker Hub |  Chain Specification File | Chain Info Reference|
   |--------------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|
   | Kate Testnet |[Releases](https://hub.docker.com/r/availj/avail/tags)|[chainspec.raw.json](https://kate.avail.tools/#/explorer/chainspec) | [Chain Info](https://availproject.github.io/assets/files/chaininfo-de1eeff4d63715bbec85aae81a956d40.txt) |

In our case we will download the chainspec into our config folder as `kate-chainspec.raw.json`

```bash
curl -L -o /mnt/avail/config/kate-chainspec.raw.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/availproject/availproject.github.io/main/static/configs/kate/chainspec.raw.json
```

Now that we've downloaded our Chainspec configuration, let's proceed to launch our Avail Node.

```bash
cd /mnt/avail

sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/config/kate-chainspec.raw.json:/da/genesis/chainspec.raw.json -v $(pwd)/state:/da/state:rw -v $(pwd)/keystore:/da/keystore:rw -e DA_CHAIN=/da/genesis/chainspec.raw.json -e DA_NAME=kate-docker-avail-Node -p 0.0.0.0:30333:30333 -p 9615:9615 -p 9933:9933 -d --restart unless-stopped availj/avail:v1.6.2-rc1
```

Now that we've downloaded our Chainspec configuration, let's proceed to launch our Avail Node. The steps in the command include:

- Navigating to `/mnt/avail` to ensure we're in the correct directory.
- Mounting `/mnt/avail/config/kate-chainspec.raw.json` to `/da/genesis/chainspec.raw.json` in the Docker container for accurate chainspec.
- Mapping `/mnt/avail/state` to `/da/state` and granting read-write permissions to ensure data persistence, even if the container crashes.
- Using `DA_CHAIN` to specify the chainspec file within the container.
- Setting `DA_NAME` as the name of your node; in our example, it's `kate-docker-avail-Node`.
- Utilizing port **`30333`** for public P2P connections, **`9615`** for the Prometheus metrics endpoint, and **`9933`** for the HTTP RPC port. For WebSocket, add port **`9944`**.
- Using an image from the Avail Docker Hub repository.
- Adding any desired chain flags after the image name, such as `--rpc`.

Inspect the Docker logs to verify that the node is functioning as expected.

```bash
ubuntu:/mnt/avail# docker ps

Your node will also appear on the [Avail Telemetry](http://telemetry.avail.tools/) 
website, listed under the "Node name" displayed in the node command output. Be sure 
to select the appropriate network tab at the top corresponding to the network you've 
joined.

That's it! You're now successfully running an Avail full node. 🎉
