The Avail team provides official Docker images designed to run nodes on the **Kate testnet**. While these guidelines focus on setting up a Full Node, they can easily be modified to accommodate the requirements for running a validator node.

## Before You Start

The following instructions are tailored for Linux distribution with `apt` 
support, such as Debian.Note that the available Docker images are compatible 
only with **Linux/amd64 or x86_64 based** CPUs. Running nodes on a cloud server 
is also common. Recommended hardware specifications for your environment are 
provided below:

| Minimum                            | Recommended                         |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 4GB RAM                            | 8GB RAM                             |
| 2 core CPU amd64/x86 architecture  | 4 core CPU  amd64/x86 architecture  |
| 20-40 GB SSD                       | 200-300 GB SSD                      |

**Port 30333** is typically required for peer exchange. Ensure this port, 
along with any others needed for machine access, is open when setting up your firewall 
or cloud provider's security groups.

#### Alternate Networks & Releases Information

The instructions provided are specifically for the **Kate testnet**.
To connect to a different network, you may need to download an alternate node version
from the [node releases
page](https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases) and acquire the corresponding
chain specification file. For any queries, feel free to reach out to the Avail team.

## Initial Setup

At this point, you should have shell access with root privileges to a linux machine.

### Install Docker

If you do not have Docker installed, please follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

In this guide, we will use the Ubuntu-specific installation instructions. It's advisable to consult the official guidelines for the most up-to-date information.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyri
